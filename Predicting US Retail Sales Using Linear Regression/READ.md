# Predicting US Retail Sales Using Linear Regression

## Objective
Predict monthly US retail sales trends using historical time-series data and linear regression.

## Description
This project analyzes historical retail sales data and builds a predictive model to forecast future sales. It focuses on identifying seasonal patterns and external economic impacts like the Great Recession and COVID-19.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Linear Regression
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Steps
1. Transformed the data into a time-series format by combining year and month columns into a single date column.
2. Visualized long-term sales trends to identify significant deviations.
3. Developed a linear regression model to predict retail sales and evaluated its performance using R-squared and mean squared error.

## Key Insights
- Retail sales trends show notable impacts during major economic events.
- Linear regression provides a robust baseline model for sales forecasting.
