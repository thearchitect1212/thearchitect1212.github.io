## Overview
This project focuses on understanding the rise of mental illness using data science. By analyzing various datasets, the goal is to uncover potential environmental contributors to mental health, such as sleep, diet, substance use, social media, and isolation. The study seeks to provide insights into how these factors influence mental well-being and explores data-driven solutions to address the mental health crisis.

## Research Questions
The project aims to answer the following key questions:
- Is there a link between sleep quality, overall well-being, and mental health?
- How does diet influence mental health?
- Could the use of substances be a significant factor in the deterioration of mental health?
- Is there a connection between social media addiction and poor mental health?
- How does social isolation affect mental health?

## Approach
Using data science techniques such as covariance, correlation, and regression analysis, the project examines the relationship between environmental factors and mental health. Visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices are employed to better understand the data and the relationships between variables.

## Data Sources

## Libraries Used
- `readxl`
- `tidyverse`
- `ppcor`
- `readr`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `GGally`
- `reshape2`

## Key Visualizations
- Scatter Plot: Used to analyze relationships between variables such as sleep, loneliness, and exercise.
- Bar Chart: Used to represent data on food consumption and depressive symptoms.
- Correlation Matrix: Helps visualize the strength and direction of relationships between various factors.

## Findings
- **Loneliness and Mental Health**: A moderate negative correlation suggests that better mental health is associated with less loneliness.
- **Sleep and Well-being**: A strong positive correlation was observed between the number of hours slept and well-being index scores.
- **Substance Use and Mental Health**: Individuals with substance use disorders experience significantly higher rates of mental health conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder compared to the general population.
- **Food and Mental Health**: Eating unhealthy foods such as fast food and sweets is associated with higher depressive symptoms, while healthier foods like fruits and vegetables are linked to better mental health.

## Future Steps
This project highlights the need for more comprehensive, longitudinal studies to explore causality in mental health. Additionally, the use of wearables and AI technology could revolutionize our understanding and management of mental health.


## Conclusion
Data science offers powerful tools to analyze and understand the factors contributing to mental illness. By leveraging these insights, we can develop more effective, data-driven strategies to improve mental well-being.
