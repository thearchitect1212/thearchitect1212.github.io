# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Python and Scikit-learn

## Overview
This project tackles the challenge of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions in a dataset with imbalanced classes. Using advanced classification algorithms, the model achieves high accuracy in detecting fraud while minimizing false positives.

---

## Key Features
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Addressed skewed data distribution using SMOTE.
- **Efficient Modeling**: Developed classification models tailored for fraud detection.
- **Visual Insights**: Analyzed patterns in fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Public dataset (Kaggle or similar source).
- **Size**: ~285,000 transactions (492 fraudulent).
- **Features**:
  - Transaction Amount
  - Time
  - Principal Components (PCA-transformed features for privacy)
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Scaled numerical features using Min-Max normalization.
  - Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset.

---

## Methodology
1. **EDA**:
   - Explored correlations between features and the target (fraud or legitimate).
   - Visualized distributions of transactions using histograms and scatter plots.
2. **Modeling**:
   - Tried Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Used metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

---

## Key Insights
- Fraudulent transactions often have distinct patterns (e.g., small amounts, high frequency).
- Balancing the dataset improves model performance significantly.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- SMOTE for resampling

---

## Applications
- **Financial Security**: Enhances fraud detection systems for banks.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Can be extended to live transaction monitoring.
- **Risk Management**: Provides insights into common fraud patterns for proactive measures.

## Future Directions
1. Integrate time-series analysis for real-time fraud detection.
2. Explore deep learning models such as LSTMs for sequence data.
3. Build a deployable API for fraud detection.
