# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Python and Scikit-learn

## Objective
Develop a predictive model to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Description
This project addresses the challenges of detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset, ensuring minimal false positives while maintaining high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Geopy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Steps
1. Preprocessed imbalanced data to avoid biased predictions.
2. Visualized patterns in fraudulent transactions, focusing on merchant categories and demographics.
3. Trained a classification model with evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Insights
- Higher prevalence of fraud in specific merchant categories, such as online and luxury purchases.
- Effective fraud detection through targeted classification models.
