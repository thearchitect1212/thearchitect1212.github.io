# Data Visualization Across Platforms: R, Python, Tableau, and Power BI

## Objective
Create cross-platform visualizations to analyze airline safety data and provide actionable insights.

## Description
The project uses diverse tools like Tableau, Power BI, R, and Python to create impactful visualizations on airline safety trends, injury rates, and accident distributions.

## Technologies Used
- R (ggplot2)
- Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau
- Power BI

## Key Steps
1. Created dashboards in Tableau and Power BI for interactive data exploration.
2. Used ggplot2 and Matplotlib for static visualizations highlighting safety trends.
3. Ensured ethical data representation to avoid sensationalism.

## Key Insights
- Air travel is significantly safer than other modes of transportation.
- High-risk phases include landing and takeoff.
