# Data Visualization Across Platforms: R, Python, Tableau, and Power BI

## Overview
This project explores the power of data visualization by analyzing airline safety data across various platforms, including R, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. The goal is to showcase the strengths and versatility of each tool in communicating insights effectively.

---

## Key Features
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Created visualizations in R, Python, Tableau, and Power BI.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Used Tableau and Power BI for dynamic, user-driven insights.
- **Static Visualizations**: Leveraged ggplot2 in R and Matplotlib in Python for publication-ready graphics.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available airline safety data.
- **Size**: Includes accident counts, fatalities, and passenger metrics over multiple decades.
- **Features**:
  - Year
  - Number of Accidents
  - Fatalities
  - Passenger Volume
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned data for missing values and outliers.
  - Aggregated yearly data for trend analysis.

---

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Compared accident rates over time to passenger volume.
   - Visualized data distributions using histograms and bar charts.
2. **Visualization Creation**:
   - **Python**: Generated line and scatter plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - **R**: Used ggplot2 for correlation and trend analysis.
   - **Tableau**: Designed dashboards for year-wise accident distributions.
   - **Power BI**: Built interactive visuals for filtering by airline and region.

---

## Key Insights
- Significant decline in accidents and fatalities over the years despite increasing passenger volumes.
- Certain flight phases, such as takeoff and landing, account for a majority of accidents.
- Interactive dashboards allowed deeper exploration of region-specific trends.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- R (ggplot2, dplyr)
- Tableau
- Power BI

---

## Applications
- **Aviation Safety**: Identifies critical phases for safety interventions.
- **Data Presentation**: Demonstrates the effectiveness of various tools in storytelling.
- **Policy Making**: Supports aviation authorities in resource allocation.
