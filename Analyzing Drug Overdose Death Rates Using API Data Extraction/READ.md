# Analyzing Drug Overdose Death Rates Using API Data Extraction

## Objective
Analyze trends in drug overdose death rates across various demographics by leveraging CDC data accessed through an API.

## Description
This project focuses on understanding patterns in drug overdose deaths by demographic factors such as age, year, and type of substances involved. It highlights how API-based data extraction can be used to automate data collection and analysis processes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- API Integration
- Data Visualization

## Key Steps
1. Accessed CDC data using an API key and parsed the JSON responses into a structured format.
2. Selected relevant columns to clean and standardize the data for analysis.
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights on overdose death rates.

## Key Insights
- Significant increase in overdose death rates over time.
- Variations in demographics, indicating high-risk groups.
