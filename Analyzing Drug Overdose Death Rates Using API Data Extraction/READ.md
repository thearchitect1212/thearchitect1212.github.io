 Analyzing Drug Overdose Death Rates Using API Data Extraction
Objective: To analyze the trends in drug overdose death rates across various demographics by leveraging CDC data accessed through an API.
Description: This project focuses on understanding patterns in drug overdose deaths by demographic factors such as age, year, and type of substances involved. It highlights how API-based data extraction can be used to automate data collection and analysis processes.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, API Integration, Data Visualization
Key Steps:
Accessed CDC data using an API key and parsed the JSON responses into a structured format.
Selected relevant columns to clean and standardize the data for analysis​(Analyzing Drug Overdose…).
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights on the impact of age and year on overdose death rates.
Key Insights: Revealed a steady increase in overdose death rates over time, with noticeable variations across demographic groups.
